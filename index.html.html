<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><em>Profile: DS Educational Foundation Inc.</em></p>
<h3>Background And Rationale:</h3>
<p style="padding: 15px 3%; border:1px solid black;background-color:lightgreen;"><em>Established in December 2024, the <strong><u>DS Educational Foundation</u></strong> was born out of a pressing need to address the significant gaps in education, health, youth development and agriculture development in Liberia.<br>According to recent statistics, only <strong>35%</strong> of children in rural Liberia have access to quality primary education, while secondary school enrollment in <strong>Nimba County</strong> stands at a mere <strong>28%.</strong><br><br>The healthcare sector faces similar strugles, with over 40% of the population lacking access to basic health services. Agriculture, which forms the backbone of Liberia's economy, is hindered by outdated methods, with less than 20% of farmers utilizing modern techniques.<br><br>Orphanages in Liberia face additional challenges. Nimba County alone has over 50 recognized orphanages, while Liberia hosts more than 200 orphanages, both recognized and unrecognized. Many of these institutions lacked proper funding, adquate facilities, and trained personel, with over 70% strugling to meet basic needs.<br>The DS Educational Foundation steps in to bridge these gaps, starting with <stron>Nimba County.</strong>Our initiatives focus on empowering underprivileged youth through technical and vocational train, supporting orphanages with educational resources, and collaboration with local farmers to modernize agricultural practices. By leveraging community-driven approaches, we aim to expand our impact across Liberia and eventually the West African region.</em></p>
